Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Co-Founder and CTO of [Ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com). Ultraleap was formerly known as Ultrahaptics and Leap Motion.

Prior to founding Ultraleap, I was a PhD student in the Bristol Interaction Group (BIG) at the University of Bristol. 

I am on the advisory board for the Computer Science Department at the University of Bristol.

I live in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol) in the UK.

I occasionally post photos from my travels on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iamtomcarter/).

You can get in contact with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamtomcarter).
